  abstract={Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide detailed information of the physical characteristics of rectum tumours. Several investigations suggest that volumetric analyses on anatomical and functional MRI contain clinically valuable information. However, manual delineation of tumours is a time consuming procedure, as it requires a high level of expertise. Here, we evaluate deep learning methods for automatic localization and segmentation of rectal cancers on multiparametric MR imaging. MRI scans (1.5T, T2-weighted, and DWI) of 140 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were included in our analysis, equally divided between discovery and validation datasets. Two expert radiologists segmented each tumor. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on the multiparametric MRIs of the discovery set to classify each voxel into tumour or non-tumour. On the independent validation dataset, the CNN showed high segmentation accuracy for reader1 (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.68) and reader2 (DSC{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.70). The area under the curve (AUC) of the resulting probability maps was very high for both readers, AUC{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.99 (SD{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.05). Our results demonstrate that deep learning can perform accurate localization and segmentation of rectal cancer in MR imaging in the majority of patients. Deep learning technologies have the potential to improve the speed and accuracy of MRI-based rectum segmentations.},

abstract = {‚ÄúRadiomics‚Äù refers to the extraction and analysis of large amounts of advanced quantitative imaging features with high throughput from medical images obtained with computed tomography, positron emission tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Importantly, these data are designed to be extracted from standard-of-care images, leading to a very large potential subject pool. Radiomics data are in a mineable form that can be used to build descriptive and predictive models relating image features to phenotypes or gene‚Äìprotein signatures. The core hypothesis of radiomics is that these models, which can include biological or medical data, can provide valuable diagnostic, prognostic or predictive information. The radiomics enterprise can be divided into distinct processes, each with its own challenges that need to be overcome: (a) image acquisition and reconstruction, (b) image segmentation and rendering, (c) feature extraction and feature qualification and (d) databases and data sharing for eventual (e) ad hoc informatics analyses. Each of these individual processes poses unique challenges. For example, optimum protocols for image acquisition and reconstruction have to be identified and harmonized. Also, segmentations have to be robust and involve minimal operator input. Features have to be generated that robustly reflect the complexity of the individual volumes, but cannot be overly complex or redundant. Furthermore, informatics databases that allow incorporation of image features and image annotations, along with medical and genetic data, have to be generated. Finally, the statistical approaches to analyze these data have to be optimized, as radiomics is not a mature field of study. Each of these processes will be discussed in turn, as well as some of their unique challenges and proposed approaches to solve them. The focus of this article will be on images of non-small-cell lung cancer.}

All patients underwent T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging before and after chemoradiotherapy; 2,252 radiomic features were extracted from each patient before and after treatment imaging. The two-sample t test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used for feature selection, whereupon a radiomics signature was built with support vector machines. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then used to develop a radiomics model incorporating the radiomics signature and independent clinicopathologic risk factors. The performance of the radiomics model was assessed by its calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness with independent validation.Results: The radiomics signature comprised 30 selected features and showed good discrimination performance in both the primary and validation cohorts. The individualized radiomics model, which incorporated the radiomics signature and tumor length, also showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9756 (95\% confidence interval, 0.9185{\textendash}0.9711) in the validation cohort, and good calibration. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the radiomics model.Conclusions: Using pre- and posttreatment MRI data, we developed a radiomics model with excellent performance for individualized, noninvasive prediction of pCR. This model may be used to identify LARC patients who can omit surgery after chemoradiotherapy. Clin Cancer Res; 23(23); 7253{\textendash}62. {\textcopyright}2017 AACR.},

abstract = { Background Radiomic features may quantify characteristics present in medical imaging. However, the lack of standardized definitions and validated reference values have hampered clinical use. Purpose To standardize a set of 174 radiomic features. Materials and Methods Radiomic features were assessed in three phases. In phase I, 487 features were derived from the basic set of 174 features. Twenty-five research teams with unique radiomics software implementations computed feature values directly from a digital phantom, without any additional image processing. In phase II, 15 teams computed values for 1347 derived features using a CT image of a patient with lung cancer and predefined image processing configurations. In both phases, consensus among the teams on the validity of tentative reference values was measured through the frequency of the modal value and classified as follows: less than three matches, weak; three to five matches, moderate; six to nine matches, strong; 10 or more matches, very strong. In the final phase (phase III), a public data set of multimodality images (CT, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and T1-weighted MRI) from 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma was used to prospectively assess reproducibility of standardized features. Results Consensus on reference values was initially weak for 232 of 302 features (76.8\%) at phase I and 703 of 1075 features (65.4\%) at phase II. At the final iteration, weak consensus remained for only two of 487 features (0.4\%) at phase I and 19 of 1347 features (1.4\%) at phase II. Strong or better consensus was achieved for 463 of 487 features (95.1\%) at phase I and 1220 of 1347 features (90.6\%) at phase II. Overall, 169 of 174 features were standardized in the first two phases. In the final validation phase (phase III), most of the 169 standardized features could be excellently reproduced (166 with CT; 164 with PET; and 164 with MRI). Conclusion A set of 169 radiomics features was standardized, which enabled verification and calibration of different radiomics software. ¬© RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Medical imaging forms a key part of clinical diagnosis, and improvements in the quality and type of information available from such images have extended the diagnostic accuracy and range of new applications in health care. Medical imaging plays an important role in neurology, cardiology, and cancer centers. This chapter provides a brief overview of the basic physics, instrumentation, and clinical applications of each imaging modality and recent technological advances. Planar X-ray imaging is used for diagnosing bone breaks, lung disease, a number of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (fluoroscopy), and conditions of the genitourinary tract, such as kidney stones. In contrast to X-ray, ultrasound, and MRI, nuclear medicine imaging techniques do not produce an anatomical map of the body, but instead image the spatial distribution of radioactive materials that are introduced into the body. Ultrasound is non-ionizing, real-time, portable, and inexpensive compared with other clinical imaging modalities. Ultrasound is particularly functional for obstetrics and quantification of blood flow using Doppler measurements. The major uses of MRI are in the areas of brain disease, spinal disorders, angiography, cardiac assessment, and musculoskeletal damage. Diffuse Optical Imaging is characterized by its noninvasive nature, chemical specificity, and good temporal resolution. NIR methods are used in mammography and real-time monitoring of blood oxygenation levels of patients during medical procedures.}

abstract = {Abstract This article provides an update on the global cancer burden using the GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%), colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47\% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64\% to 95\%) versus transitioned (32\% to 56\%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

abstract = {Abstract This article provides a status report on the global burden of cancer worldwide using the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a focus on geographic variability across 20 world regions. There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6\% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4\% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6\%), prostate cancer (7.1\%), and colorectal cancer (6.1\%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2\%), stomach cancer (8.2\%), and liver cancer (8.2\%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

abstract={Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

For a particular choice of parameters, the algorithm provides a super astronomical period of 219937 ‚àí1 and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32-bit accuracy, while using a working area of only 624 words. This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 ‚â§ v ‚â§ 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational complexity O(p2) where  p is the degree of the polynomial.We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},

Since LASSO uses the L1 penalty, the optimization should rely on the quadratic program (QP) or general non-linear program which is known to be computational intensive. In this paper, we propose a gradient descent algorithm for LASSO. Even though the final result is slightly less accurate, the proposed algorithm is computationally simpler than QP or non-linear program, and so can be applied to large size problems. We provide the convergence rate of the algorithm, and illustrate it with simulated models as well as real data sets.},
