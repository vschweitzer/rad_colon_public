# Notes

[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7423816/) 
seems to provide a semi-tutorial approach and may be useful 
to follow.

It seems to be recommended to stick to the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) guidelines[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7423816/)[[2]](https://ibsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## PyRadiomics extraction

Extraction can be customized [[3]](https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization.html#radiomics-parameter-file-label). 
TODO: Check all available options and try to create a config 
file for further testing (which featureClasses to use and
which to ignore may be of special importance).
